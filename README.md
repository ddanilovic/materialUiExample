# FRONTEND DEVELOPER TEST

In this repository you will find example screenshots of one of our UI designs. To see your style of working and how you solve real-live problems, we have created some requirements for you to solve around this UI design. This will allow us to better evaluate your skills in relation to our requirements, and should also give you an insight on what we are working on.

## What needs to be done (mandatory)

* Create a functional page using HTML, CSS, React and [Material-UI Components](https://material-ui.com/) based on the attached UI designs (see: [screen1-full.png](./screen1-full.png))
* Use as much of the standard Material UI components as possible. 
* Customize Material UI to fulfill the requirements of the design accordingly. 
* Create clean and lean HTML and CSS code.
* Use the provided JSon file (data.json) in the 'resources/data' folder for all the data to be rendered on the page.  
* Use the provided icons from the icon font (pure) in the 'resources/icons' folder.
* Use the provided font (SourceSansPro-Regular) in the 'resources/font' folder

## Optional / Nice to have / Bells and Whistles ##

* Implement the header bar including the following logic (left title and right menu icons):
  - By default only a grey bottom border is shown ([screen1-full.png](./screen1-full.png)).
  - If the content is higher than the current screen size and a vertical scrollbar is shown, the header has to stay fixed and the content has to scroll under it.
  - Once the user starts scrolling, an additional drop shadow is shown for the header (see: [screen2a-part1.png](./screen2a-part1.png) and [screen2b-part2.png](./screen2b-part2.png)).

* Implement the "add to cart" button including the following logic: 
  - By default the button is shown in the item details next to the image ([screen2a-part1.png](screen2a-part1.png)).
  - If this section is not visible on the screen anymore, the "add to cart" button has to be displayed in the header bar ([screen2b-part2.png](screen2b-part2.png)).
  
* Implement a shopping cart animation, after an item is added to the cart
  - If the user clicks the "add to cart" button the number of items in the shopping cart has to change (in the header).
  - Add an animation for the shopping cart icon and/or the number, to visually indicate the change.
  - Be creative and make everything look as nice as possible
  
* Responsive

## Expected Outcome

* An HTML page that comes as close as possible to the attached UI designs and works in all major browsers.
